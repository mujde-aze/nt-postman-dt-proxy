## Overview

These functions are responsible for retrieving and updating contacts through the DT API.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

If running locally, consider using the [Firebase emulator](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/connect_auth) to run these functions locally.
But before running the emulator, be sure to compile TS first with `npm run build`.

### Installing

Installing is the responsibility of the CI/CD pipeline. Push a tag and the Github action will do the rest.

## Running the tests

To run the tests, issue `npm run test`.

## Branching Model
We use [GitHubFlow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for this project.

## Deployment

The CI/CD pipeline takes care of deployment once you create a [semver](https://semver.org/) compliant tag.
